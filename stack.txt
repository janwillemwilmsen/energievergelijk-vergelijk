Am trying to build a blog with a static json file in Nuxt(with http module).
Using the Nuxt 'Mountains' example as a base, for testing. Saved the api response as json in the 'static' folder.
(Example is here: https://nuxtjs.org/examples/data-fetching-fetch-hook)

Using 'fetch' to connect to the json in static folder on the Blog-page is working. See:
https://3udju.sse.codesandbox.io/blog

Have problems with using Fetch to identify the individual node. See:
https://3udju.sse.codesandbox.io/blog/mount-everest   (No content here)

I have no idea how to recreate this - with the local Json file instead of the Api url:
https://api.nuxtjs.dev/mountains/${this.$route.params.slug}

And the _slug.vue file:
https://codesandbox.io/s/nuxt-http-fetch-static-json-3udju?file=/pages/blog/_slug.vue


Have tried to use a Filter on the Fetch. Have tried different querystrings as parameters on the .json, but its not working.

Have searched for :
- get data from json slug id
- get object based on slug in local json
- fetch local json filter on slug
Watched several youtubes about Fetch but haven't found anything. 

If anyone has a clue or can point me towards an solution, much appreciated.

==============================

Hi, 

Fetch / http problem.

Trying to manage content by Fetching data from a GoogleSheets (used the Mountains-example from Docs as a base). 
Created the Sheet and set up permissions to share the data.

Tried two approaches:
- Create script to download the json in Static folder, use blogs.json in Fetch.
- Connect to GoogleSheet 'endpoint/output' with Fetch.

In both approaches I am able to create a list with the items. But the individual detailpages don't show data. 
Tried to change '${this.$route.params.slug}' on the endpoint, tried to use a 'Route.query', tried to change 'Keys', but no result.

Json data from GoogleSheets:

Any suggestion on how to fix this is appreciated!
